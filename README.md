# expenses-tracker

An app made with GoLang to track expenses and payments. MongoDB has been selected as its DB due to its high performance. 

In the future, it will consist of a GUI (developed with Fyne) to manage the expenses. Plus, it will also have an alternative shape: web app (made with Gin for the backend and React-TypeScript for the frontend).

Right now, there is implemented a test app with Fyne. Credits belong to https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-create-a-simple-data-entry-desktop-app-with-golang-and-fyne-7c9e543d71e.
