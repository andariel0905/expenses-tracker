# expenses-tracker

An app made with GoLang to track expenses and payments. MongoDB has been selected as its DB due to its high performance. 

In the future, it will consist of a GUI (developed with vyne) to manage the expenses. Plus, it will also have an alternative shape: web app (made with Gin for the backend and React-TypeScript for the frontend).
